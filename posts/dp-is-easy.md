Yes am not saying that but it is, you just need to get things for the basics

## Two methods

- Recursive Top Down Memoization
- Iterative Bottom Up Tabulation

## Coin Change II https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/

- Paste each line of the problem in the code as comments this will make understanding easier
- Take a look at the examples input and outputs
- Write a short summary of the problem
- Now think of those small independently

- Take ith or skip ith ... and so on
- Now simulate an general example let say ith.
